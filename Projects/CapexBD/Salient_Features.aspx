                    be selected from the drop-down list. If it is not entered, you don’t have to stop
                    the data entry. There is facility to enter the same.

                    The most important aspect of “SETTING” is that, data appearing in the drop-down
                    list come from project related files and not from the master database. This generates
                    the choicest reports without undesired entries.
