        <span class="spanbig">CapexBD </span>is a business planning and marketing tool for
        standard capital equipment. Major portion of the turnover of organizations manufacturing
        these equipment comes from turnkey projects. Due to various reasons, it is difficult
        to forecast business for the next 3-4 years.</p>
    <p class="matter">
        <span class="spanbig">CapexBD</span> serves precisely this purpose, besides, presenting
        data leading sales and marketing staff directly to action points. Importantly, it
        is an integral part of company’s routine operations and is flexible to absorb the
        changes in the market.</p>
    <p class="matter">
        Below here is the summary of the activities involved in their implementation of
        a turnkey project.</p>
    <p class="matter">
        The promoter - ultimate owner of the project - drafts a scheme for setting up a
        manufacturing facility for certain product. A technical consultant is appointed
        for engineering services such as technology transfer, selection of equipment, identifying
        vendors/contractors, site supervision, etc. Based on recommendations of the consultant,
        contract for construction of the plant is awarded to a contractor on turn-key basis
        who procures the equipment from the manufacturers approved by the consultant and
        puts them together at site. Many a times the work is split into different packages.
        The promoter places the orders directly on the sub-contractors.
    </p>
    <p class="matter">
        After construction, erection and successful commissioning, the project is handed
        over to the promoter.</p>
    <p class="matter">
        You - the equipment manufacturer - have to follow these developments closely and
        collect, compile and utilize the information for taking decisions and further planning.
    </p>
    <p class="matter">
        Preliminary spadework involves finding out potential for each equipment required
        in all packages in that project, ensuring consultant’s approval, securing enquiries
        the purchaser - be it the promoter or the contractor – besides keeping watch on
        competitors’ activities. This involves a lot of co-ordination within and outside
        of organization.</p>
    <p class="matter">
        Little extra efforts can ensure that specifications are in your favor, competition
        is marginalized and the purchaser - be it the promoter or the contractor – is inclined
        to placing the order on you...</p>
    <p class="matter"> …then follows the routine procurement process.</p>
    <p class="matter">
        That is what <span class="spanbig">CapexBD</span>  is meant for – pre-enquiry activities which improve the chances
        of order. But that is not the sole purpose of using <span class="spanbig">CapexBD</span> . It keeps track of developments
        and presents data for routing activity planning. Over the period history becomes
